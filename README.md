ConnectTel Telecom Company is grappling with a high rate of customer churn, which is seriously impacting their long-term growth and viability. They've noticed their existing strategies for keeping customers just aren't cutting it anymore, and as a result, they're losing out to the competition.

So, they've decided to take a more sophisticated approach by creating a system that can predict when customers are likely to leave. That's where I come in. They've asked me to develop this system as a Data Scientist. The plan is to use all the data they have on customers and apply machine learning and analytics to identify who's at risk of leaving.

The goal is to spot these patterns early so that ConnectTel can step in with some targeted actions to keep these customers. It's all about getting ahead of the problem to keep their customers happy and loyal, which in turn helps them stay competitive in the fast-moving telecom sector.
